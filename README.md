# Keanu Philosopher 🎯

> *"I don't know the answer. But... whoa." — Keanu, probably*

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Arcane

### Team Members
- **Team Lead:** Ashish Krishna KM – Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology  
- **Member 2:** Joson Jose – Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology

## 🧘 Project Description  
**Keanu Philosopher** is a gloriously unhelpful AI chatbot that offers deep, vague, and often hilariously cryptic philosophical advice powered by Google’s **Gemini API**. It has a sleek frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and a Flask backend that delivers timeless wisdom (and nothing useful).

You ask questions — Keanu *responds with vibes*.

---

## 🤷 The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People want accurate, practical, well-researched answers.

We disagree. We believe that **nobody really knows anything** — and that’s where Keanu Philosopher comes in.

---

## 😌 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built a web-based AI assistant that uses **Google Gemini API** to craft responses like a calm monk on a motorcycle. Rather than helping, it makes you stop and think,  
> *"Am I the bug… or is the code within me?"*
