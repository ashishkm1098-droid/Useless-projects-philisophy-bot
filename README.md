# 🧘‍♂️ Keanu Philosopher 🎯

> *"I don't know the answer. But... whoa." — Keanu, probably*

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**Keanu Philosopher** is a gloriously unhelpful AI chatbot that offers deep, vague, and often hilariously cryptic philosophical advice powered by Google’s **Gemini API**. It has a sleek frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and a Flask backend that delivers timeless wisdom (and nothing useful).

You ask questions — Keanu *responds with vibes*.

---

## 🚫 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

People are always looking for practical, accurate, helpful answers.

But what if the real problem… is seeking answers at all?

---

## ✅ The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We built a web-based chatbot inspired by the deepest Keanus and most confused philosophers. It uses **Google Gemini API** to give you profound-sounding non-answers that make you stop, breathe, and question reality.
