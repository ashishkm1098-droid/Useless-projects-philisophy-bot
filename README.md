# 🧘‍♂️ Holy Keanu 🎯

> *"I don't know the answer. But... whoa." — Keanu, probably*

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**Holy Keanu** is a gloriously unhelpful AI chatbot that offers deep, vague, and often hilariously cryptic philosophical advice powered by Google’s **Gemini API**. It has a sleek frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and a Flask backend that delivers timeless wisdom (and nothing useful).

You ask questions — Keanu *responds with vibes*.

## 🚫 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

People are always looking for practical, accurate, helpful answers.

But what if the real problem… is seeking answers at all?

---

## ✅ The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We built a web-based chatbot inspired by the deepest Keanus and most confused philosophers. It uses **Google Gemini API** to give you profound-sounding non-answers that make you stop, breathe, and question reality.

   ▼
[1] Enters a question in chat box (HTML/CSS/JS frontend)
   │
   ▼
[2] JavaScript sends the input to Flask backend via POST request (AJAX/fetch)
   │
   ▼
[3] Flask backend receives the message
   │
   ▼
[4] Flask sends it as a prompt to Google Gemini API
   │
   ▼
[5] Gemini returns a philosophical (and useless) response
   │
   ▼
[6] Flask sends this response back to the frontend
   │

[7] JavaScript updates the UI to show "Holy Keanu’s" response)
